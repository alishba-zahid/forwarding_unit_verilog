# forwarding_unit_and_hazard_detection_verilog
#Project Overview

This project implements a Forwarding Unit and Hazard Detection Unit in Verilog for a pipelined processor. These components help mitigate data hazards by forwarding necessary data and stalling the pipeline when required.

#Features

Detects data hazards in a pipelined processor

Implements forwarding to reduce pipeline stalls

Stalls pipeline when forwarding is insufficient

Compatible with standard MIPS or RISC-V pipeline architectures

#Technologies Used

Verilog HDL

ModelSim/Vivado for simulation

Testbench for validation
